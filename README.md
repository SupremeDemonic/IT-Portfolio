🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio – SupremeDemonic

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my projects, experience, and passion for cybersecurity, all through a lens that reflects who I am: a command-line enthusiast with a drive for building secure, innovative, and efficient systems.
💻 Terminal-Inspired Portfolio

[🔗 Check it out here](https://supremedemonic.github.io/IT-Portfolio/public/index.html)

My portfolio is designed to look and feel like a macOS terminal—interactive, minimal, and powerful. It’s built to reflect my appreciation for the command line and how I leverage it in real-world scenarios. Whether you’re browsing through my projects or learning about my background, the terminal interface is my way of letting you step into my world.
👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity at Full Sail University, graduating in July 2025. I hold an Associate of Science in Information Technology from Full Sail as well, where I graduated as Salutatorian with a 3.99 GPA and received two Directors' Awards for academic excellence.

My passion for cybersecurity stems from hands-on experience—building a home lab, automating tasks with Python, and analyzing real-world threats. I’ve also worked in environments that demanded both technical knowledge and strict adherence to data protection standards.
