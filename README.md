## 💻 Terminal-Inspired Portfolio

🔗 [Check it out here](https://supremedemonic.github.io/IT-Portfolio/public/index.html)

My portfolio is designed to look and feel like a macOS terminal—interactive, minimal, and powerful. It’s built to reflect my appreciation for the command line and how I leverage it in real-world scenarios. Whether you’re browsing through my projects or learning about my background, the terminal interface is my way of letting you step into my world.

## 👨‍🎓 About Me

I'm currently pursuing a **Bachelor of Science in Cybersecurity** at **Full Sail University**, graduating in July 2025. I hold an **Associate of Science in Information Technology** from Full Sail as well, where I graduated as **Salutatorian** with a **3.99 GPA** and received two **Directors' Awards** for academic excellence.

My passion for cybersecurity stems from hands-on experience—building a home lab, automating tasks with Python, and analyzing real-world threats. I’ve also worked in environments that demanded both technical knowledge and strict adherence to data protection standards.
